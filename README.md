**Author**: [Benjamin Jaron](mailto:bmjaron@gmail.com)

## Overview 

This project analyzes several movie data files in order to help Microsoft develop profitable content. The analysis below will demonstrate the need to invest heavily in order to make a profitable film, that Jason Blum is the film producer most likely to guarantee success, and that horror and its subsets are a lucrative genre.

## Business Problem

Microsoft has witnessed the trend of major companies producing original video content. Microsoft wants to develop its own films, but needs to know what factors make films successful and profitable. The below analysis will sift through data in order to help Microsoft reach its goals. 

## Data 

The data files used for this analysis include:

1. An IMDB database that includes tables with many films, their information, and detailed tables about their personnel.
2. A Box Office Mojo gross file, which is a table containing a list of movies, which studio produced the movie, and its domestic and foreign gross. 
3. A Rotten Tomatoes file containing each film and a synopsis. 
4. A file containing each movie, its budget and its foreign and domestic gross. 
5. A TMDB file that contains each movie, and various information about that movie, like genre and original language. 

The most useful files will be the IMDB database, the BOM gross file and the movie budget file. 

## Methods 

This project uses correlation to show the relationship between production budget and gross, creates a multiple to show the relationship between production budget and gross, and uses other basic statistics to determine which indsutry personnel are best suited for success. 

## Results 

There is a high correlation between production budget and gross, especially for films spending above the 90th percentile of production budget.

We were also able to conclude the producer Jason Blum has a consistently high gross/budget multiple.

## Conclusions 

In order to succeed Microsoft should follow the following 3 strategies: 

 1. Spend big in order to earn big.
